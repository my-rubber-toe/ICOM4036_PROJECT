# ICOM4036 Project: Device Communications

## Description
Design a new programming language to simplify the communication between
devices: The new language must be declarative and functional and provide
simple functionality to create local servers and allow communication with
external servers. You must clearly define the syntax of the new language.

-  Use Python libraries (e.g. PLY) to develop the scanner, parser and
intermediate code.
- Develop a short video (up to 4 minutes) to demonstrate the features of your
language.
- Provide a public GitHub repo with your code and documentation. Be sure all
members of the team are equally contributing to the project.
